# Phantom-Cyber
Phantom Playbook and App Contest

# Blog
In an effort to demonstrate building and automating the next generation networks, I’ve submitted on behalf of World Wide Technology, these entries in the 2016 Phantom playbook and app contest. 

This contest is sponsored by Phantom (www.phantom.us) to promote the community development of playbooks and apps, the press release is available at http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160120005085/en

*Phantom is a Security Automation & Orchestration platform that integrates with existing security technologies in order to provide a layer of “connective tissue” between them.  Phantom doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead uses Playbooks and Apps to make them smarter, faster and stronger.*

## F5 App
At World Wide Technology, we are engaging with customers in their evaluation of Phantom and this video clip provides a demonstration of the playbooks and apps developed to ingest data through the REST API and then implement a firewall rule on a F5 BIG-IP appliance to block the source IP address identified in the artifact.

## Metadata Collection
This utility creates containers and artifacts via the Phantom REST API from metadata off Cisco IP Phones. It is used to programatically create incidents for testing the F5 and Meraki apps.

## Meraki App
*Integrating Cloud Controlled WiFi, Routing and Security with Security Automation and Orchestration*

Cisco Meraki is a cloud managed architecture, which is used to deploy, configure, manage and monitor WiFI, routing and security appliances in small to medium branch office locations. Phantom Cyber is an extensible security automation and orchestration package which allow custom applications to be written within its framework. This video demonstrates how the Meraki device provisioning APIs can be used by a Phantom app to quickly locate devices in the Meraki network.
