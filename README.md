In an effort to demonstrate building and automating the next generation networks, I’ve submitted on behalf of World Wide Technology, an entry in the 2016 Phantom playbook and app contest. 

This contest is sponsored by Phantom (www.phantom.us) to promote the community development of playbooks and apps, the press release is available at http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160120005085/en

*Phantom is a Security Automation & Orchestration platform that integrates with existing security technologies in order to provide a layer of “connective tissue” between them.  Phantom doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead uses Playbooks and Apps to make them smarter, faster and stronger.*

At World Wide Technology, we are engaging with customers in their evaluation of Phantom and this video clip provides a demonstration of the playbooks and apps developed to ingest data through the REST API and then implement a firewall rule on a F5 BIG-IP appliance to block the source IP address identified in the artifact.
